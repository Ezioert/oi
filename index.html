        <p class="text-muted" >Named after St. Joseph, St Joseph's High School (SJHS) was established in 1960 to provide a Catholic secondary school for the graduates of the Immaculate Conception Free School, a charitable primary school for young boys that were jointly run by the De La Salle Brothers in the Philippines and the Young Ladies' Association of Charity. Br. Francis Cody FSC sought the assistance of the benefactors of the Immaculate Conception Free School in the establishment of a De La Salle Secondary School. Adjoining with the Free School, a 1.3-hectare lot was donated by Alfredo Montelibano Sr. to the De La Salle Brothers.[3]

          The school opened with forty-five graduates of the Free School and charged minimal fees. Moreover, Bacolod's affluent families shouldered the construction of the classrooms, library, science laboratories, work education building, as well as other financial needs. In the succeeding years, the school went on to accept graduates of both the Free School and the Barrio Obrero Elementary School. In 1966, the Brothers decided to open an adult night high school to serve the needs of adults who earned their income during the day but still wanted to pursue their education.[3]
          
          In the 1960s, when Negros Occidental suddenly faced a recession, the financial support that is being given to the Brothers decreased. This forced the Brothers to gradually phase out the Free School by 1971. The teachers, however, were retained to teach in the high school. In its first decades of operation, SJHS was imposing that parents would suggest the same kind of Christian education for their young girls. In that same year of 1971, the brothers deliberated on the matter where SJHS finally adopted a co-educational system. With this adoption, its population gently accelerated. In 1993, the school also embraced the Tuition Fee Categorization, with three categories to make their education more accessible. This was then further studied until the school year 2003â€“2004 where the school implemented the Socialized Tuition Scheme having a range of five categories.[3]</p>
